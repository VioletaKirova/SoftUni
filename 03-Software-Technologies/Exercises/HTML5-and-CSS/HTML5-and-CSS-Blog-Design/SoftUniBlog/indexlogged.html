                    <p>
                        It's important that we talk about women in tech, and women in the workplace generally.

                        2017 (and 2018 so far) has seen an explosion of women opening up about sexism in their workplaces, from the athletes of USA Gymnastics to Susan Fowler's expose of her treatment at Uber and the thousands of other women who have raised their voices with the flag of the #Metoo movement.

                        And with the raising of these voices have come hundreds of thinkpieces, discussing incredibly important questions of the roots of workplace sexism and, most importantly, how we can best do away with hiring discrimination in the tech industry.
                        "This doesn't fix the 'real problem'!"
                        I can't even count the number of thinkpieces I've read in the past year or so that have criticized a technology or hiring practice because it misses "the root cause," "the point," or, most frustratingly, "the real problem."

                        Katharine Zaleski's widely read New York Times op-ed criticizes voice-warping technology that masks the gender of interview applicants because it's a "distraction from the hard work of evaluating and fixing the ways in which their cultures drive out the women who are actually hired."

                        This Medium article argues that we need to stop stop focusing on hiring more women, and focus instead on encouraging women to pursue software engineering in college. Another Times op-ed argues companies should focus less on driving more women to enter the field, and more on decreasing sexism in the hiring process.

                        Tech Crunch claims that above all else, hiring more women is the "simple solution to tech's gender imbalance," while Entrepreneur counters that companies should stop focusing on hiring more women and focus instead on getting the women it has into leadership positions.

                        It's important to note that all of these pieces are incredibly insightful, and are written by women with extensive personal experience with the issues they're writing about. But perhaps the fact that they all come to different conclusions about what the "real" problem with workplace sexism is indicates that maybe we're going about this conversation the wrong way.
